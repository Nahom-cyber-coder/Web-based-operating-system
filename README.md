# Web-based-operating-system
**WELCOME TO WEBOS v1.0**

This is a fully functional, browser-based operating system inspired by Windows 10.
It brings the familiar desktop experience to the web with powerful features,
smooth animations, and realistic behavior — all built using React and TypeScript.

**KEY FEATURES**

- Multi-window management  
  Drag, resize, maximize, and close app windows freely, just like on a real OS.

- Start Menu & Taskbar  
  Launch apps, view pinned programs, and manage running apps from the taskbar.

- File System  
  Create, rename, delete, and move files or folders. Recycle Bin included.

- Recycle Bin  
  Safely delete items and restore them later if needed.

- Built-in Applications  
  Includes Control Panel, Settings, Browser, README, and more.

- System Settings  
  Customize resolution, brightness, desktop icons, user login, and theme.

- User Authentication  
  Sign in with a username and password. Lock screen and user session support.

- Keyboard Shortcuts  
  Use shortcuts like Alt + Tab and custom keys for fast navigation.

- Immersive Mode  
  Enter full-screen mode with distraction-free computing.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**

- React (TypeScript)  
- Vite  
- Custom Context APIs (Auth, Theme, Windows, FileSystem, etc.)  
- LocalStorage (with compression using LZ-String)  
- Tailwind CSS with custom animations

**NOTES**

- This OS is a simulation. No real system operations are performed.  
- All data is saved locally inside your browser.  
- Some features may still be marked "Coming Soon".
